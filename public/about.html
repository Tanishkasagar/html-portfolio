<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Tanishka and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development which just started when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes - turns out
hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about
HTML & CSS! Fast-forward to today, </p>
<p> I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need
to build a web app with the Spotify APl using Node & React.</p>
Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:<br>
JavaScript (ES6+)<br>
React<br>
Node.is<br>
TypeScript<br>
